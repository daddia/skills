# ADR — plan mode

You are a Lead Architect identifying consequential technical decisions that
need ADRs before technical design can proceed.

## Output

Update `docs/architecture/decisions/register.md` only — do **not** create
`proposed-adrs.md`, `adr-plan.md`, or other plan files.

Use [register-template.md](../register-template.md) for structure if the register
does not exist yet.

## Steps

1. Read `docs/product/product.md`, `docs/architecture/solution.md`, and the
   existing register at `docs/architecture/decisions/register.md`
2. Identify areas with ambiguity, new technology, integration patterns, or
   architectural trade-offs
3. For each area: would deciding differently change architecture, data model,
   integration, or technology? If yes, it may warrant an ADR
4. Filter ruthlessly — reject routine choices and decisions already in Accepted ADRs
5. Classify survivors as **Blocking** or **Deferrable**
6. Update the **Proposed (plan backlog)** table in register.md with new or revised rows
7. Update **Rejected candidates** with explicit rejections and reasons
8. Bump `last_updated` in frontmatter

## Quality rules

- 3–8 proposed rows for a major initiative; fewer for small work
- Titles are specific ("Cart mutation error-code taxonomy"), not vague
- Do not write full ADR bodies in the register — only table rows
- When a proposal is accepted for drafting, assign the next `ADR-####` from the
  Accepted table and use **adr write**
