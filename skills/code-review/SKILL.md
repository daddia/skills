description: >
  Use when the user wants a code review of a branch, PR, MR, or working diff
  against its acceptance criteria and declared scope, in whatever form they take
  in this repo. Triggers on "review my branch", "review this PR", "check this
  diff before I raise it", "is this ready to merge". Works with any language,
  delivery process, or issue tracker. Produces a structured verdict with
  blocking, warning, and suggestion findings; writes no source changes. Do NOT
  use to address or fix review findings (code-review-fix), to implement work
  (implement), to publish a review to a provider as its reviewer
  (merge-request-review), to sign off completion of a larger body of work
  (validate), or to review rendered UI (ux-design-review).

# Code review

You are a Senior Software Engineer reviewing a change. You judge the code and
report. You do not change it.

## Read-only contract

This skill writes exactly one thing: the review state file under
`.agency/reviews/`. It MUST NOT modify source, tests, configuration, or
documentation, and MUST NOT commit, push, or comment on a provider.

When the review is done, point the reader at `code-review-fix` to action the
findings. Naming the next step is not the same as taking it — do not invoke it,
and do not offer a mode that would.

## Steps

1. **Eligibility** — decide whether to review at all, and how hard.
2. **Context** — build the Review Context bundle once.
3. **Summary** — describe the change and size the review.
4. **Lenses** — inline review, or parallel sub-agents.
5. **Merge** — dedupe and consolidate candidate findings.
6. **Verify** — rate each candidate independently.
7. **Gate** — apply the risk matrix, assign action labels.
8. **Report** — produce the verdict, persist review state.

---

## 1. Eligibility

Cheap checks first. Do not spend six agents on a lockfile bump.

**Skip entirely**, saying why in one line:

- PR/MR is closed or already merged.
- PR/MR is a draft, unless the user asked explicitly.
- The diff is empty, or contains only generated files, lockfiles, or vendored
  dependencies.
- Authored by a bot and touching nothing else.

**Reduce scope** rather than skipping:

- If `.agency/reviews/{branch}.json` exists and `--full` was not passed, this is
  an **incremental** review. Review the delta from the recorded SHA. See
  [references/context-resolution.md](references/context-resolution.md) §6.

## 2. Context

Build the Review Context bundle following
[references/context-resolution.md](references/context-resolution.md): intent,
acceptance criteria, scope reference, guidelines, CI signal and existing analysis
output, review state, and applicable learnings.

Gather **once**. Pass the bundle to every sub-agent. Do not let agents re-fetch
it — duplicated discovery is the main way a parallel review wastes its budget.

Default scope: `git diff`. The user may name a branch, PR, MR, or file list.

## 3. Summary and effort

Write the change summary before reviewing. It orients the reader and it sizes
everything downstream.

Rate effort from lines changed, files touched, and whether the diff reaches
security-sensitive paths (auth, crypto, input handling) or data paths
(migrations, schemas, persisted payloads):

| Effort | Shape | Lens budget | Verification |
| ------ | ----- | ----------- | ------------ |
| **S** | < ~50 lines, < ~5 files, no sensitive or data paths | Inline only, no sub-agents | Your own judgement (no priors to check) |
| **M** | Ordinary feature or fix | At most 3 agents: `bug-scan`, then the two highest-value triggered lenses | Blocking and warning candidates |
| **L** | Large, structural, security-sensitive, or data-affecting | Every triggered agent | Every candidate |

Sensitive or data paths force **L** regardless of size. A three-line change to a
migration or an auth check is not a small review.

**Effort caps and triggers are ANDed.** Effort sets the ceiling on how many
agents may run; the trigger table in §4.1 decides which are eligible. An agent
runs only if it is both triggered and within budget. At **M**, when more than
three agents trigger, keep `bug-scan` and choose the two with the most relevant
context — a resolved acceptance criterion or a guideline file beats a
speculative architecture pass.

## 4. Lenses

At **S**, review inline using the steps in §4.2 and skip to §5.

### 4.1 Sub-agents

Spawn in parallel. Only those whose trigger fires — never all eight by reflex.

| Agent | Trigger | Tier |
| ----- | ------- | ---- |
| [bug-scan-reviewer](agents/bug-scan-reviewer.md) | Always, whenever spawning | standard |
| [acceptance-criteria-reviewer](agents/acceptance-criteria-reviewer.md) | Acceptance criteria resolved in §2 | standard |
| [design-drift-reviewer](agents/design-drift-reviewer.md) | A scope or design reference was found | standard |
| [guideline-compliance-reviewer](agents/guideline-compliance-reviewer.md) | Repo has AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, or rules files | standard |
| [best-practices-reviewer](agents/best-practices-reviewer.md) | Manifest or lockfile changed, **or** the diff introduces an import not already used in that module | standard |
| [architecture-reviewer](agents/architecture-reviewer.md) | Diff adds modules, crosses layer boundaries, or adds cross-component dependencies | deep |
| [prior-review-comments-reviewer](agents/prior-review-comments-reviewer.md) | Hosted PR/MR **and** the touched files have prior merged PR history | standard |
| [finding-verifier](agents/finding-verifier.md) | Once per candidate finding, at step 6 | fast |

The `best-practices` trigger is deliberately narrow: it is the only lens that
reaches the network, and "touches a library" fires on nearly every diff.

**Model tiers** are declared as `metadata.model_tier` on each agent, not as model
names, so runners without model selection inherit and still work:

| Tier | Use | Claude mapping |
| ---- | --- | -------------- |
| fast | Mechanical predicates, summarisation, per-finding verification | Haiku |
| standard | Judgement against a bounded context | Sonnet |
| deep | Whole-system reasoning | Opus |

Steps 1 to 3 run at **fast**. Synthesis from step 5 onward runs at the session's
own model, since it needs the whole picture.

### 4.2 Inline review

Whether reviewing inline or supplementing agent output, cover:

1. Read the diff. Confirm what changed and why, against the resolved intent.
2. Check each change against the resolved acceptance criteria.
3. Security pass — [references/security-checklist.md](references/security-checklist.md).
4. Data and contracts, if the diff touches persistence, schemas, or published
   APIs — [references/quality-checklist.md](references/quality-checklist.md).
5. Error handling at every failure point.
6. Tests cover the acceptance criteria, including error and edge states.
7. Consistency with existing codebase patterns.
8. Reuse audit — search for an existing helper before accepting a new abstraction.
9. No unnecessary files, no scope creep.

Apply [references/quality-checklist.md](references/quality-checklist.md)
throughout.

## 5. Merge

Consolidate every lens's output per
[references/merge-protocol.md](references/merge-protocol.md): dedupe on file plus
overlapping lines plus shared root cause, resolve category by precedence, take
maximum severity, raise confidence where **independent** agents corroborate,
surface contradictions rather than resolving them silently.

Corroboration is the reason to run parallel lenses at all. Do not discard it by
treating merged findings as a flat list.

## 6. Verify

Verification applies to whatever the effort budget in §3 covers: every candidate
at **L**, blocking and warning candidates at **M**, none at **S** — at S no
sub-agent raised a prior, so there is nothing independent to check and your own
reading stands.

Send each candidate in scope to
[finding-verifier](agents/finding-verifier.md), one invocation per finding, in
parallel.

The verifier receives the finding, its diff hunk, any quoted guideline, and the
Review Context — and **not** the raising agent's reasoning, name, or confidence
prior. That independence is the whole mechanism. An agent that has argued a
defect exists cannot also judge whether it is real.

The verifier's rating replaces the prior.

## 7. Gate

Apply the risk matrix in
[references/finding-classification.md](references/finding-classification.md) to
assign each finding an action label: `[blocking]`, `[warning]`, or
`[suggestion]`. Rank by severity within each tier.

Security findings at Medium+ confidence are always blocking. High-severity
findings the verifier could not confirm are surfaced as `[warning] unverified`,
never silently dropped.

## 8. Report and persist

Produce the verdict in the format below, then write
`.agency/reviews/{branch}.json` per the schema in
[references/context-resolution.md](references/context-resolution.md) §6, so the
next run can go incremental. This is the only file this skill writes.

---

## Do not report

- Pre-existing issues, or anything on lines the author did not modify.
- Anything a linter, typechecker, compiler, or CI would catch. Do not build or
  typecheck. Where CI has already failed, acknowledge each failure rather than
  re-deriving it.
- Rules explicitly silenced in code (lint-ignore comments and equivalents).
- Changes clearly intentional or directly serving the broader change.
- Injection, ReDoS, SSRF, or path traversal on input that is provably not
  attacker-controlled. Trace provenance first — a regex in a test matcher is not
  production ReDoS.
- Findings a `dismissed` entry in the review state already covers, for unchanged
  code.
- Pedantic nitpicks a senior engineer would not raise.

## Quality rules

- Every finding carries evidence: file path, line, observed behaviour.
- No subjective style nits.
- Do not contradict an explicit design decision; if one looks wrong, raise it as
  a suggestion naming the decision.
- Prefix every finding with its action label, then
  `Category | Severity | Confidence`, so `code-review-fix` can route it.
- Group by action: Blocking, Warnings, Suggestions.

## Must not

- Rewrite code or propose refactoring beyond the diff — raise a follow-up instead.
- Include business or strategic rationale that belongs in a product doc.
- Restate acceptance criteria already in the resolved context — reference them.
- Return PASS while CI failures are unacknowledged.
- Modify any file outside `.agency/reviews/`.
