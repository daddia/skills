# Design source resolution

Self-contained discovery rules for the **design source of truth** — what the
implemented UI is supposed to look like. This skill makes no assumption
about design tooling: it discovers whatever exists and degrades gracefully.
Resolve once, up front, and pass the result to every sub-agent.

## Resolution ladder

Stop at the first level that yields a usable source; combine levels when
they complement (a Figma node for layout + a tokens file for values):

1. **Explicit argument** — the user passed a Figma URL, mockup path, or
   spec link.
2. **Linked from the work item** — a Figma/design link in the PR or MR
   description, the linked issue/ticket, or a local spec file
   (`**/design.md`, `SPEC*.md`) associated with the change.
3. **Figma via MCP** — when a Figma MCP server is connected (official Dev
   Mode server, remote or desktop) and a node URL/ID is known:
   - screenshot of the node (`get_image` / `get_screenshot`) — visual truth;
   - variable definitions (`get_variable_defs`) — token truth (color,
     spacing, typography);
   - code/design context and the Code Connect map where available —
     intended component mapping.
   Tool names vary by server version — discover what the connected server
   exposes. The server needs a node reference; never guess node IDs. If a
   Figma link exists but no MCP server is connected, say so — do not
   scrape.
4. **Design artifacts in the repo** — exported mockups/screenshots
   (`design/`, `docs/design/`, `mockups/`, image files referenced by the
   work item), redlines, or spec documents.
5. **Tokens and style guide** — a design-tokens file (`tokens.*`,
   `theme.*`, CSS custom properties, Tailwind config), brand/style-guide
   docs, Storybook. No layout truth, but authoritative for values.
6. **Design principles doc** — `DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`, brand guidelines
   named in `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`. Judgement criteria, not a comparison
   target.
7. **None found** — judge against the application's own internal
   consistency plus [ux-heuristics.md](ux-heuristics.md), and **say so
   explicitly** in the verdict ("no design source — reviewed for internal
   consistency and UX heuristics"). Never silently invent a standard.

## What each level supports

| Level | Fidelity comparison | Token audit | Heuristic bar |
| ----- | ------------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Figma via MCP | yes — pixel/screenshot + variables | yes | yes |
| Repo mockups/specs | yes — visual | only if values annotated | yes |
| Tokens/style guide | no layout truth | yes | yes |
| Principles doc | no | no | yes — sharpened |
| None | no | no | yes — heuristics only |

Spawn `design-fidelity-reviewer` only at levels 1–4; below that there is
nothing to be faithful to.

## Recording the resolution

Produce a short bundle and reuse it verbatim across the review and every
sub-agent:

```text
Design source: <level & what> — <node URL / file paths, or "none">
Access: <Figma MCP tools available | files read | n/a>
Covers: <which changed components the source actually shows>
Intentional deviations: <called out in work item/PR, or "none stated">
```

Deviations the work item or PR description explicitly calls out are not
findings — record them here so no lens re-flags them.
