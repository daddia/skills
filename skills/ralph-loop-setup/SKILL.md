  Use to seed or configure a Ralph loop before running it: choose a preset
  (engineering delivery for an epic, ad-hoc for a single repeating prompt, or
  custom steps), resolve the environment, set the completion promise and
  iteration budget, and write the loop files. Triggers on "set up a ralph
  loop", "configure a ralph loop", "ralph-loop-setup", or naming an epic to
  loop over. Do NOT use to start, inspect, or stop a loop (ralph-loop) — setup
  never executes loop steps.

# Ralph loop setup

Resolve configuration and seed the loop files. **Never start the loop.** Setup
ends with a summary and an instruction to run `/ralph-loop start`.

Writing is done by `scripts/seed-ralph-loop.sh`, not by hand. Your job is to
resolve values and call it. Hand-authoring the loop file reintroduces the
unsubstituted-placeholder failure the script exists to prevent: a stray
`{{MAX_ITERATIONS}}` in the frontmatter fails the hook's numeric validation and
silently deletes the loop.

## Interview

Ask only what you cannot resolve yourself. Use structured questions, not prose.

1. **Preset.** If not given:
   - `engineering-delivery` — drive an epic through implement, review,
     validate, and merge request, one task per iteration.
   - `ad-hoc` — repeat a single prompt until it is done.
   - `custom` — define your own steps.

2. **Target.** The epic slug or ID for engineering delivery; the task prompt
   for ad-hoc; the step list for custom.

3. **Budgets.** Max iterations. Default 50, but for engineering delivery
   propose `tasks × 6 + 10`, since a 12-task epic will not fit in 50.

4. **Completion promise.** Propose a default and confirm it. For an epic, the
   slug upper-snake-cased with `_COMPLETE`.

5. **Environment.** Only for presets that need it, per
   [references/environment-resolution.md](references/environment-resolution.md).

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve the agent

`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` set means `claude`; `CURSOR_PROJECT_DIR` set means
`cursor`. This determines the base directory (`.claude/loop` or
`.cursor/loop`). There is no pointer file and no `--ralph-dir` flag.

### 2. Resolve the preset inputs

**engineering-delivery**

- Resolve `{epic}` per
  [../backlog/references/delivery-conventions.md](../backlog/references/delivery-conventions.md):
  a slug, an epic ID resolved via the backlog row, or a path.
- Locate `tasks.md` and `design.md`. Fail loudly, naming the missing file, if
  either is absent.
- Derive a dependency-safe task order: topological by declared dependencies,
  stable by document order on ties. Render as
  `N. {TASK_ID} — <title> (depends on: <ids or ->)`.
- Resolve the branch. Report the expected branch; never create or switch one.
- Resolve validation commands, tracker actions, and UI signals per
  [references/environment-resolution.md](references/environment-resolution.md).

**ad-hoc**

Write the task prompt to a file and pass `--prompt-file`. Apply
[../ralph-loop/references/prompt-authoring.md](../ralph-loop/references/prompt-authoring.md):
explicit completion criteria, a verification step each iteration, and an
escape hatch for being stuck.

**custom**

Write the step definitions to a file and pass `--steps-file`. Each step needs a
name, what to do, and which step comes next. See
[../ralph-loop/references/preset-authoring.md](../ralph-loop/references/preset-authoring.md).

### 3. Seed

Call the script. Every template value goes through `--set`:

```bash
scripts/seed-ralph-loop.sh \
  --agent claude \
  --preset engineering-delivery \
  --run-id "{epic}-$(date -u +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)" \
  --max-iterations 70 \
  --completion-promise CHECKOUT_FOUNDATION_COMPLETE \
  --session-id "$SESSION_ID" \
  --set EPIC=checkout-foundation \
  --set BRANCH=feat/checkout-foundation \
  --set TASKS_PATH=docs/work/checkout-foundation/tasks.md \
  --set DESIGN_PATH=docs/work/checkout-foundation/design.md \
  --set FIRST_ITEM=CHK01-01 \
  --set "WORK_SEQUENCE=$(cat sequence.txt)" \
  --set "GOAL=..." --set "DONE_CRITERIA=..." --set "PRESET_CONTEXT=..."
```

Run with `--dry-run` first when anything is uncertain. The script refuses to
overwrite a loop past iteration 1 without `--force`, and exits non-zero on any
unresolved placeholder.

### 4. Report

Files written, resolved configuration, expected branch, and "Run
`/ralph-loop start` to begin." Nothing else.

## Policies

- MUST NOT execute loop steps or launch sub-agents. Setup only writes files.
- MUST NOT create or switch git branches.
- MUST NOT hand-author `active.md`, `loop-state.md`, or `context.md`.
- MUST fail loudly, naming the file, when a required source is missing.
- MUST NOT invent a task order that ignores declared dependencies.

## Anti-patterns

- Writing the loop file directly instead of calling the seed script.
- Starting the loop after seeding it.
- Guessing at validation commands rather than resolving them from the repo.
- Setting a completion promise the loop has no way to verify.
