# Feature

Implements a story with approved requirements and design, against `design.md`
and `tasks.md`.

## Router

1. Mode is `implement` (default when user says "feature implement").
2. Follow [prompts/implement.prompt.md](prompts/implement.prompt.md).

Pass story id and context after the mode token.
