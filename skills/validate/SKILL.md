  Use when the user wants final epic completion sign-off: every task in
  work/{epic}/tasks.md verified against Gherkin AC and roadmap phase exit
  criteria. Pass epic slug or ID. Do NOT use for PR or branch code review
  (code-review), writing tasks (tasks), or sprint retrospective (sprint). Not
  for drafting backlog or design.

# Validate

## Conventions

Read [../backlog/references/delivery-conventions.md](../backlog/references/delivery-conventions.md)
when resolving `{epic}`.

## Sub-agents

When the epic has many tasks (roughly >5) or complex Gherkin, spawn **ac-evidence-verifier**
([agents/ac-evidence-verifier.md](agents/ac-evidence-verifier.md)) to build the acceptance
matrix before writing the report and updating tasks.md.

For eval runs on skills in this repo, use root **eval-grader** (`agents/eval-grader.md`).

## Gotchas

- **Code review ≠ validate** — review judges the diff; validate judges epic done-ness vs AC.
- **Resolve slug from backlog** when user passes only an Epic ID.
- **Update tasks.md status** only with evidence; do not invent new AC.
- **Epic status in backlog** updates only when all tasks for the epic are verified.
