# Solution — write mode

Read [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md).

You are a Senior Solution Architect writing arc42-lite solution design.

## Path

Default: `docs/architecture/solution.md`. If the user names another path, use it.

## Stage (`--stage`)

- `stub` — Phase 0: fill §1–§2 only; scaffold §3–11 as `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`. ≤2 pages.
- `full` — Phase 2+: all eleven sections. 8–12 pages.

## Negative constraints

solution.md MUST NOT contain:

- Commercial rationale, personas, positioning → `docs/product/product.md`
- Story-level acceptance criteria → `work/{epic}/tasks.md`
- Phase sequencing → `docs/product/roadmap.md`

## Context

<artifacts>
[Stub: docs/product/product.md, architecture principles, system boundary
Full: product.md, work/{epic}/design.md (walking-skeleton), ADR register,
accepted ADRs]
</artifacts>

## Steps (stub)

1. Read product.md and architecture principles
2. §1 Context and scope — boundary, C4 L1 (ASCII), owns / does not own
3. §2 Quality goals and constraints — top 3–5 NFRs, constraints
4. Scaffold §3–11 with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`
5. Delete the `<!-- DO NOT INCLUDE -->` comment block before saving

## Steps (full)

1. Read all context
2. §1 Context and scope
3. §2 Quality goals and constraints
4. §3 Solution strategy — style, key choices, principles vs quality goals
5. §4 Building block view — C4 L2/L3, module layout
6. §5 Runtime view — 2–5 key sequences
7. §6 Data model and ubiquitous language
8. §7 Cross-cutting concepts — observability, errors, security, testing
9. §8 Deployment and environments
10. §9 Architectural decisions — links to ADRs in `docs/architecture/decisions/`; mark gaps as "_(Not yet written)_"
11. §10 Risks, technical debt, open questions
12. §11 Graduation candidates — patterns that may lift org-wide when reused
13. Delete the `<!-- DO NOT INCLUDE -->` comment block before saving

## Quality rules

- §1 includes text-based C4 L1 diagram
- §3 names trade-offs, not only choices
- §9 does not invent full ADR bodies — link or mark candidates
- Do not repeat business context from product.md — link instead

## Output format

Markdown with YAML frontmatter. Save to the resolved path. Use [assets/solution.template.md](../assets/solution.template.md).
