# Agent Skills for AI-First Product Delivery

Opinionated agent skills for the full delivery loop — product strategy, architecture, backlog, design, implementation, review, and sprint-end refinement.

These skills are the executable form of a structured delivery method:

- **Phase model** — Phase 0 (walking skeleton) → Phase 2+ (TDD)
- **Topic skills with modes** — e.g. `product write`, `backlog review`, `feature implement`
- **Artefact references** — `{source}:{path}` URI scheme for cross-repo links
- **EARS + Gherkin** acceptance criteria at story level
- **Negative constraints** — every skill explicitly states what it is *not* for

Designed to compose: each skill consumes upstream artefacts and produces a single
named artefact downstream skills can read. Routing is description-based; **space-index**
handles ambiguous requests.

## Document layout (default)

```text
docs/
├── product/
│   ├── product.md
│   ├── roadmap.md
│   └── backlog.md
└── architecture/
    ├── solution.md
    └── decisions/
        ├── register.md
        └── ADR-NNNN-{title}.md
```

Work-package artefacts live under `work/{wp}/` (`design.md`, `tasks.md`, etc.).

Each skill documents default paths under `docs/`. If you name a different path in your prompt, the agent uses that instead.

Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills) layout:
`SKILL.md`, `prompts/` for mode instructions, `assets/*.template.md` for artefact
scaffolds, and `examples/` for reference outputs.

Skills work with [Cursor](https://cursor.com/docs/skills),
[Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills), and any
[open agent skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) consumer.

Invoke with mode first, e.g. `/product write --stage pitch`, `/tasks write work/checkout/01-foundations`. Override paths in natural language when needed.

## Planning & strategy

- **product** — Pitch or full `product.md`.
- **roadmap** — Outcome-based phases with exit criteria.
- **backlog** — Product backlog (epics by default) at `docs/product/backlog.md`.
- **tasks** — Work-package tasks from design/spec at `work/{wp}/tasks.md`.

## Architecture & design

- **solution** — Stub or full arc42-lite architecture.
- **adr** — Proposed rows in `register.md`; full ADRs as `ADR-NNNN-{title}.md`.
- **design** — Work-package `design.md`.

## Implementation

- **feature**, **code-review**, **code-refactor**, **validate**, **create-mr** (consume `tasks.md` for AC)

## Review & refine

- **docs**, **retrospective**, topic **review** / **refine** modes

## Routing

- **space-index** — Pick skill and mode for vague requests.

## Compatibility
