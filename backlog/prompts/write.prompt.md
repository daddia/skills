# Backlog — write mode

You are a Senior Delivery Engineer writing a backlog at portfolio, product,
domain, or work-package scope.

Read [shared.md](../shared.md) for scope/save paths and artefact boundaries.

## Arguments

Mode is already `write`. Scope is `$1`, name is `$2` (where applicable), flags follow:

| Flag | Applies to | Effect |
| ---- | ---------- | ------ |
| `--depth full` | portfolio / product / domain | Full epic detail for all phases (default: Now-phase detail only) |

**Depth calibration (default):** Now-phase epics have full detail; later-phase
epics are single-line placeholders. If removing a phase wouldn't block Story 1
on Monday, that phase detail belongs in a later revision.

## Context

<artifacts>
[Provided by the caller:
  Portfolio/product/domain scope: product.md, roadmap.md, solution.md, contracts.md
  Work-package scope: parent backlog.md (the owning epic entry),
  work/{wp}/design.md (work-package), solution.md, contracts.md]
</artifacts>

## Steps (portfolio / product / domain scope)

1. Read product.md, roadmap.md, and solution.md before writing anything
2. Write a summary: objective, delivery approach, prerequisites (complete + required), out-of-scope pointer (reference `product.md §5` and `roadmap.md §Later` — do not restate them)
3. Define conventions table: epic ID format, story ID format, status values, priority levels, estimation method
4. Build the epic breakdown table:
   - Now-phase rows: full columns (ID, title, phase, priority, deps, points, WP path, status)
   - Next/Later-phase rows: same columns but scope/deliverables left as placeholders
5. Write full epic detail entries **for Now-phase epics only** (default) — scope, key deliverables, dependencies, status, WP link
6. Build the dependency graph (ASCII) and enumerate the critical path
7. Describe parallelisation opportunities
8. Define the minimum viable slice
9. List assumptions (impact if wrong) and delivery risks; reference `solution.md §10.1` for technical risks — do not duplicate them

## Steps (work-package scope)

1. Read the parent epic entry in the owning backlog.md, plus `work/{wp}/design.md` and `solution.md`
2. Write a summary: epic ID, phase, priority, estimate, scope, deliverables, dependencies, downstream consumers
3. Define conventions table
4. Write each story using the canonical schema (see shared.md)
5. Build traceability: stories to solution sections + stories to product outcomes
6. Write the Definition of Done
7. List WP-specific delivery risks; reference `solution.md §10.1` for technical risks
8. Write the handoff section: what this WP leaves stable, what comes next

## Quality rules

- Domain backlog: Now-phase epics have full detail by default; later phases are placeholders unless `--depth full` is passed
- Every epic must have a named work-package path (even if "(planned)")
- Work-package stories MUST use the canonical EARS + Gherkin schema — no plain AC checklist
- Domain delivery risks must not duplicate technical risks already in `solution.md §10.1`
- Out-of-scope: reference `product.md §5` and `roadmap.md §Later` rather than restating items

## Output format

Write as a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter. Save path per [shared.md](../shared.md).

Use [template.md](../template.md) as your structural scaffold.

Examples: [examples/domain-backlog.md](../examples/domain-backlog.md),
[examples/wp01-backlog.md](../examples/wp01-backlog.md).
